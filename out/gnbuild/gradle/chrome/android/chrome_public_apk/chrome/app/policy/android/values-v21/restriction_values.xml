  <string name="AllowedDomainsForAppsTitle">Define domains allowed to access Google Apps</string>
  <string name="AllowedDomainsForAppsDesc">Enables Chromium\'s
restricted log in feature in Google Apps and prevents users from
changing this setting.

If you define this setting, the user will only be able to access
Google Apps (such as Gmail) using accounts from the specified domains.

This setting will NOT prevent the user from loging in on a managed device
that requires Google authentication. The user will still be allowed to
sign in to accounts from other domains, but they will receive an error
when trying to use Google Apps with those accounts.

If you leave this setting empty/not-configured, the user will be able to
access Google Apps with any account.

This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to
all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in
https://support.google.com/a/answer/1668854.

Users cannot change or override this setting.</string>
  <string name="AlternateErrorPagesEnabledTitle">Enable alternate error pages</string>
  <string name="AlternateErrorPagesEnabledDesc">Enables the use of alternate error pages that are built into Chromium (such as \'page not found\') and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you enable this setting, alternate error pages are used.

If you disable this setting, alternate error pages are never used.

If you enable or disable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Chromium.

If this policy is left not set, this will be enabled but the user will be able to change it.</string>
  <string name="AuthAndroidNegotiateAccountTypeTitle">Account type for HTTP Negotiate authentication</string>
  <string name="AuthAndroidNegotiateAccountTypeDesc">Specifies the account type of the accounts provided by the Android authentication app that supports HTTP Negotiate authentication (e.g. Kerberos authentication). This information should be available from the supplier of the authentication app. For more details see https://goo.gl/hajyfN.

If no setting is provided, HTTP Negotiate authentication is disabled on Android.</string>
  <string name="AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelistTitle">Kerberos delegation server whitelist</string>
  <string name="AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelistDesc">Servers that Chromium may delegate to.

Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards (*) are allowed.

If you leave this policy not set Chromium will not delegate user credentials even if a server is detected as Intranet.</string>
  <string name="AuthSchemesTitle">Supported authentication schemes</string>
  <string name="AuthSchemesDesc">Specifies which HTTP authentication schemes are supported by Chromium.

Possible values are \'basic\', \'digest\', \'ntlm\' and \'negotiate\'. Separate multiple values with commas.

If this policy is left not set, all four schemes will be used.</string>
  <string name="AuthServerWhitelistTitle">Authentication server whitelist</string>
  <string name="AuthServerWhitelistDesc">Specifies which servers should be whitelisted for integrated authentication. Integrated authentication is only enabled when Chromium receives an authentication challenge from a proxy or from a server which is in this permitted list.

Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards (*) are allowed.

If you leave this policy not set Chromium will try to detect if a server is on the Intranet and only then will it respond to IWA requests.  If a server is detected as Internet then IWA requests from it will be ignored by Chromium.</string>
  <string name="AutoFillEnabledTitle">Enable AutoFill</string>
  <string name="AutoFillEnabledDesc">Enables Chromium\'s AutoFill feature and allows users to auto complete web forms using previously stored information such as address or credit card information.

If you disable this setting, AutoFill will be inaccessible to users.

If you enable this setting or do not set a value, AutoFill will remain under the control of the user. This will allow them to configure AutoFill profiles and to switch AutoFill on or off at their own discretion.</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements to the listed URLs.

This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect misissued certificates for those hosts.

A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</string>
  <string name="ContextualSearchEnabledTitle">Enable Touch to Search</string>

Exceptions can be defined in the URL whitelist policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

This policy can be used to open exceptions to restrictive blacklists. For example, \'*\' can be blacklisted to block all requests, and this policy can be used to allow access to a limited list of URLs. It can be used to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths.

The most specific filter will determine if a URL is blocked or allowed. The whitelist takes precedence over the blacklist.
